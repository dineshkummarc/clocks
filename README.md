__TODO

cache the fonts!

daylight saving times!!

delete function!

Update time in clocks (setInterval, on seconds, we update GMT, and then refresh the clocks...)

make the separator (:) blink (toggle aclass?)

arrow cursor on text (bar is ugly)

re-order clock so they appear in chronologic order (past -present - future)

if the clock already exist, dont add it again...


todo: on some instance, the time wrap on another line (ex: 10:35)

position and stretch the clocks all dynamically, so they always fill all the screen: 
 - may not be possible to keep everything relative in size
 - can the canvas be stretched: yes, but there aliasing, it's not vector...

find a "slugify" function, and use it to generate IDS based on name (lowercase, and special_chars_cleanup)


Autocomplete: 
 - when user press enter on suggestion, submit!
 - maybe auto-fill the field (instead of simply suggesting under...)

set a BG image on the delete submit button..

On a mouse device only, we only show the delete option when the clock is overed (it shows option).
 - On touch device, options are always there, or just hidden (simpler app.)


12/24 format
 - bind js action onto these buttons
 - should it submit a form? no, just a post... can it be radios???
 - radio that autosubmit the form when changed...



todo: add timezones in the autocomplete and support for them...

todo: add alternate spelling for major cities... (localized + accronyms)


todo: position in css all time digit statically (with left and right alignement...)

todo: rollover bug with fadein colcks (just added ones...)

todo: data: add a top hit value, so we suggest more important cities first.
